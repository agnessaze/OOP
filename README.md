# Python OOP Practice

This repository contains exercises and example implementations to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It is designed to help me (Agnesa) solidify my understanding of core OOP principles through hands-on coding challenges and examples.

## Contents

- `inheritance.py` — Examples of class inheritance, method overriding, and use of `super()`
- `abstract_classes.py` — Implementation of abstract base classes and enforcing method implementation in subclasses
- `mixins.py` — Demonstration of mixins for adding reusable functionalities through multiple inheritance
- `composition_vs_inheritance.py` — Code exploring the differences between composition and inheritance
- `duck_typing.py` — Examples of polymorphism and duck typing in Python

## How to Use

You can run any of the Python files directly to see the examples in action. For instance:

```bash
python inheritance.py
```
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

## Learning Goals

- Understand and apply class inheritance and method overriding  
- Learn to create and use abstract base classes  
- Use mixins for clean multiple inheritance design  
- Differentiate between composition and inheritance design patterns  
- Practice polymorphism with duck typing  

## Future Plans

- Add unit tests to validate the code examples automatically  
- Implement design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer  
- Explore advanced OOP topics such as metaclasses and descriptors  
- Build small projects applying OOP principles
