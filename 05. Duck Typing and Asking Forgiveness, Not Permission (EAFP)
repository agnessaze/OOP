"""Task: Create a Media Player with Polymorphism

Create an abstract class Media with a method play()

Subclasses:

Song → plays audio

Podcast → plays voice

Audiobook → plays narration

Create a list of different media objects and call .play() on each
(They should all behave differently but use the same method)"""
